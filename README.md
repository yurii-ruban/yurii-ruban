## Hi there, I am Yurii
- 👋 After graduating my university in Kyiv in the distant 2019, I started my software engineering career.
- 🛠️ I've been working as a C++ developer for about 6 years and the more I work with C++, the less I know about it 😆. Also, I have small experience with Python and consider learning Javascript.
- 🏭 Areas: browser development, development for automotive insustry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with sw engineering enthusiasts who like creating amazing apps or just have fun learning something new.
