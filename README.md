## Hi there, I am Yurii
- 👋 After graduating my university in Kyiv in the distant 2019, I started my software engineering career.
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in backend development rather than frontend. But sometimes I like creating something with fancy UI.
- 🛠️ I've been working as a C++ developer for about 3 years and the more I work with C++, the less I know about it 😆. Also, I have small experience with Python and consider learning Javascript.
- 🏭 Areas: browser development, development for automotive insustry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and refreshing all about user-space development for Linux. My next plans include figuring out cryptography, network protocols and blockchain. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with sw engineering enthusiasts who like creating amazing apps or just have fun learning something new.
